# Hello! I'm Connor 👋
I work as a **Wildfire GIS Analyst** in the state of Alaska. I’ve been programming for about 1.5 years — mostly in Python — and recently started using Git to help manage some of the projects I've created at my job. I'm excited about geospatial programming and hope to continue growing my skills in this direction.
